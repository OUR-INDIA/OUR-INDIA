            Nalanda was established by emperor Kumaragupta I of the Gupta Empire around 427 CE,and was supported by numerous Indian and Javanese patrons – both Buddhists and non-Buddhists.Nalanda continued to thrive with the support of the rulers of the Pala Empire (r. 750–1161 CE).Over some 750 years, Nalanda's faculty included some of the most revered scholars of Mahayana Buddhism.
